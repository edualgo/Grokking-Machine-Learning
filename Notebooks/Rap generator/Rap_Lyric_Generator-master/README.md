<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>A project that trains a Hidden Markov Model over a dataset of rap song lyrics. You can generate a rap using a single word as the starting point. This the code for 'Generate Rap Lyrics'.</p>

<p>A Markov chain is a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event. A countably infinite sequence, in which the chain moves state at discrete time steps, gives a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC). A continuous-time process is called a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). It is named after the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov.</p>

<p>Markov chains have many applications as statistical models of real-world processes, such as studying cruise control systems in motor vehicles, queues or lines of customers arriving at an airport, currency exchange rates and animal population dynamics.</p>

<h1>Hidden Markov chains</h1>

<p>Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are probabilistic models, it implies that the Markov Model underlying the data is hidden or unknown. More specifically, we only know observational data and not information about the states.</p>

<h1>Dependencies</h1>

<ul>
<li>Python 3.7+ (https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)</li>
</ul>

<p>Use <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip">pip</a> to install any missing dependencies</p>

<h1>Basic Usage</h1>

<p>Once you've downloaded the repository simply type the following into terminal</p>

<p><code>MarkovRap.py some_word_goes_here</code></p>

<p>Replace 'some<em>word</em>goes_here' with a word of your choosing. The rap will be generated from your word.</p>
