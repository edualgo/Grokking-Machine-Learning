# Traffic Signs Recognition 

This Project is based on **Convolutional Neural Networks**. Python Programming language has been used to train and test the model. It recognizes different traffic signs. I have used ***Google Colab*** to train and test the model as we can train the model using GPU in Colab and that is very fast as compared to CPU. The more number of epochs takes more time in training the model. A **convolution** multiplies a matrix of pixels with a filter matrix or ‘kernel’ and sums up the multiplication values.

## Dataset

I have trained the dataset from Kaggle Competition. The dataset comprises of meta folder, train folder and test folder and csv files. There are ***more than 40 classes and 50,000 images*** in the dataset.
